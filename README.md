# Algorithms 2 Projects

## Overview
Within this repository, you will find the 5 projects I have completed for CS 1501: Algorithms and Data Structures 2. Below is a brief description of each project. For more details, see the individual READMEs for each project.

## Project 1: Binary Search Tree
Project 1 required me to implement a binary search tree using a given node class that could add, remove, and check for elements, as well as determine its height and whether or not it is balanced, perform both pre-order and in-order traversals for serialization, and reverse itself.

## Project 2: Auto-complete Engine
Project 2 required me to implement a simple auto-complete engine that would perform character-by-character searches and reccomend users words based on both a dictionary and a user history. Doing so required the implementation of 2 different DLBs and a system for tracking word frequency.

## Project 3: Car Priority Queue
Project 3 required me to implement a priority queue system that could determine the lowest price and mileage cars both in general and of a specific make and model. Doing so required implementing a car object, 2 DLBs, and a minimum heap.

## Project 4: Network Analysis
Project 4 required me to implement a network analysis system that could determine the lowest latency path between two points, the bandwidth along a path, whether or not the graph was connected by copper links, and whether the graph would be connected given any two vertices failing, as wel as producing a lowest-latency spanning tree. Doing so required implementing both Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithms, along with cprresponding priority queues, a path object, and an edge object.

## Project 5: BigInteger Multiplication and XGCD
Project 5 required me to implement a multiplication and extended Euclidean GCD for a BigInteger object. Doing so required implementing grade school multiplication over bytes, the Euclidean algorithm, division, and shifting algorithms that could work on byte arrays of arbitrary length.
