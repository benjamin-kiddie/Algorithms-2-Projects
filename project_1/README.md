# Binary Search Tree

## Project Overview
Assigned as project 1 of course CS 1501 (Algorithms and Data Structures 2). Requires the creation of a binary search tree that implements the following methods:

1. `put(T key)` - Adds a new key to the BST.
2. `contains(T key)` - Checks if the BST contains a key.
3. `delete(T key)` - Removes a key from the BST if present.
4. `height()` - Determines the height of the BST.
5. `isBalanced()` - Determines if the BST is balanced.
6. `inOrderTraversal()` - Produces a ':' seperated string of all keys in the BST in ascending order.
7. `serialize()` - Performs a pre-order traversal of the BST and produces a comma-seperated string representation of it, using various symbols to represent kinds of nodes. More details in code comments.
8. `reverse()` - Produces a reversed deep copy of the tree.
